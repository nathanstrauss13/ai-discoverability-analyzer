# Anti-Bot Protection Solutions for AI Discoverability Analyzer

## Current Issue
Many corporate websites (like signetjewelers.com) block automated requests with 403 Forbidden errors, preventing the analyzer from accessing their content.

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Headers
- Rotate User-Agent strings
- Add more realistic browser headers
- Include referer headers
- Implement cookie handling

### 2. Request Timing
- Add random delays between requests
- Implement rate limiting
- Mimic human browsing patterns

### 3. Browser Automation
- Use Selenium or Playwright for JavaScript rendering
- Handle dynamic content loading
- Execute JavaScript challenges
- Capture rendered HTML after page load

### 4. Proxy Rotation
- Use rotating proxy services
- Implement IP rotation
- Geographic distribution of requests

### 5. Alternative Approaches
- Provide instructions for users to save HTML locally
- Create browser extension for client-side analysis
- Offer API endpoint for pre-fetched content
- Partner with websites for authorized access

## Recommended Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Improve error messaging to explain why certain sites can't be analyzed
2. **Short-term**: Add browser automation option for JavaScript-heavy sites
3. **Long-term**: Develop partnerships or alternative analysis methods

## Sites Known to Block Automated Access
- signetjewelers.com
- Many e-commerce platforms
- Financial institutions
- Sites with sensitive data
- High-traffic corporate websites

## User Workarounds
1. Save the webpage as HTML and analyze locally
2. Use browser developer tools to inspect elements manually
