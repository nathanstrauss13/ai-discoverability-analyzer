# PDF Handling in AI Discoverability Analyzer

## Current Behavior
The analyzer now properly detects and handles PDF URLs with a clear error message explaining why PDFs cannot be analyzed.

## Detection Methods
1. **URL Extension Check**: Detects URLs ending in `.pdf`
2. **Content-Type Check**: Detects PDFs via HTTP Content-Type header
3. **URL Pattern Check**: Catches PDFs with "application/pdf" in the URL

## Why PDFs Cannot Be Analyzed

### Technical Limitations
- PDFs are binary files, not HTML
- No DOM structure to parse
- No meta tags or semantic HTML
- Limited accessibility for crawlers

### AI Discoverability Issues
- **No Structured Data**: PDFs lack JSON-LD, microdata, or RDFa
- **No Meta Tags**: No title tags, meta descriptions, or Open Graph tags
- **Poor Semantic Structure**: No H1-H6 hierarchy, just visual formatting
- **Limited Accessibility**: Screen readers and crawlers struggle with PDFs
- **No Crawlability Files**: Can't have robots.txt or sitemap.xml

## Recommended Alternatives

### For Users
1. **Find the Host Page**: Most PDFs are linked from HTML pages - analyze those instead
2. **Convert to HTML**: Use online PDF-to-HTML converters
3. **Request HTML Version**: Many organizations provide both PDF and HTML versions

### For Publishers
1. **Publish HTML First**: Create web pages with the same content
2. **Use PDFs for Downloads Only**: Keep primary content in HTML
3. **Add Metadata**: If you must use PDFs, add proper metadata
4. **Create Landing Pages**: Make HTML pages that describe and link to PDFs

## Example Error Message
When a user tries to analyze a PDF, they see:
```
**PDF files cannot be analyzed directly.**

This tool is designed to analyze HTML web pages, not PDF documents.

**Options for PDF content:**
1. If the PDF is a report/document on a website, analyze the webpage that hosts it instead
2. Convert the PDF to HTML using online tools, then analyze the HTML
3. Look for an HTML version of the same content

**Why PDFs are challenging for AI discoverability:**
• PDFs are primarily designed for printing, not web crawling
• They lack semantic HTML structure
• No meta tags, headings hierarchy, or structured data
• Limited accessibility for screen readers and crawlers

For better AI discoverability, content should be published as HTML web pages.

## Future Enhancements
1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Could extract text and provide basic analysis
2. **PDF Metadata Reading**: Could read PDF metadata fields
3. **Conversion Service**: Could integrate PDF-to-HTML conversion
4. **Landing Page Generator**: Could help create HTML pages for PDFs
