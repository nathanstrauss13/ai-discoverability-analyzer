# AI Discoverability Analyzer

A web application that analyzes websites to determine how well they are optimized for AI and Large Language Model (LLM) crawling and processing.

## Features

- **URL Analysis**: Enter any website URL to analyze its AI readiness
- **AI Readiness Score**: Get a comprehensive score (0-100) based on multiple factors
- **Technical Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of:
  - Page title and meta descriptions
  - Heading structure (H1-H6)
  - Image alt text coverage
  - Structured data presence
  - Semantic HTML usage
  - Table and form elements
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Receive specific, actionable recommendations powered by Claude AI
- **Clean, Modern UI**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Installation

1. Clone or download this directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Anthropic API key:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5001`
3. Enter a URL to analyze
4. Review the AI readiness score and recommendations

### Example URLs to Try

Some websites block automated requests. Here are examples that typically work:
- `https://example.com` - Simple test site
- `https://wikipedia.org` - Well-structured content
- `https://github.com` - Good semantic HTML
- Most personal blogs and smaller websites

Note: Large corporate sites often have anti-bot protection that may block analysis.

## How It Works

The analyzer evaluates websites based on several key factors that affect AI/LLM processing:

- **Content Structure**: Proper use of headings, semantic HTML elements
- **Metadata**: Title tags, meta descriptions for context
- **Accessibility**: Alt text for images, proper markup
- **Machine Readability**: Structured data, clean HTML
- **Data Organization**: Tables for tabular data, clear content hierarchy

## Scoring System

- **80-100**: Excellent - Well-optimized for AI systems
- **60-79**: Good - Has room for improvement
- **0-59**: Needs Work - Significant improvements recommended

## Technologies Used

- Flask (Python web framework)
- Beautiful Soup (HTML parsing)
- Anthropic Claude API (AI recommendations)
- Modern CSS with responsive design
