# GitHub Setup Instructions

To push this code to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., "ai-discoverability-analyzer")
3. Choose whether to make it public or private
4. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Add Remote Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/nathanstrauss/Desktop/innate\ apps/ai-discoverability-analyzer

# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-discoverability-analyzer.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

## 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is named 'master' instead of 'main', use:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## 4. Verify

Visit your GitHub repository URL to confirm all files have been uploaded successfully.
